To create a New Relic account, go to New Relic's [signup page](https://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window"). Or, if you have a specific offer from a [New Relic partner](http://www.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-based-installation/log-install-new-relic-partners), follow that link directly.

If you have already created an account, but are having trouble logging in, see [Troubleshoot password or login problems](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/troubleshoot-password-or-login-problems).

Account security
----------------

New Relic uses a [role-based structure](http://www.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles) so that you have direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](http://www.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/why-new-relic/security).

Add to allow list
-----------------

**Recommendation:** Add `noreply@newrelic.com` and `*@mailer-d.newrelic.com` to your allow list of trusted email sources. This helps to:

*   Prevent New Relic emails from being trapped in your spam filters.
*   Prevent your email from being added to suppression lists.

For help with adding email addresses to your allow list, contact your organization's email administrator.

Sign up for New Relic account
-----------------------------

From [New Relic's account signup page](https://newrelic.com/signup):

1.  Follow the online steps to create your account.
2.  Agree to the [Terms of Service](https://newrelic.com/terms "Link opens in a new window").
3.  When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account, sign in to New Relic, and complete the deployment process.
